  PUF(physical unclonable function) is a kind of security chip that could generate unclonable output by using process variation. This project used different machine learning models(LR, SVM, CMA-ES) to predict the output of PUF. Experiments showed that LR, SVM, CMA-ES can all predict PUF's output precisely.
